## About

Hi, I'm a bioinformatician and sysadmin currently living in the beautiful (and rather cold) city of Kingston, Ontario. 
This webpage is the current home of my portfolio, blog, 
and generally is intended to be the place to stay updated with all I do.

If you're here now, you've likely noticed this website is still under construction. 
The main reason it's online is that I like GitHub and online version control.
