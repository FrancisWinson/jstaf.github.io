## HIGHLIGHTS
  

* High level of fluency in multiple programming languages, including: R, Python, MATLAB, Java, SQL, and bash ([see portfolio](https://github.com/jstaf/)).
* Wide-ranging molecular biology skillset, including but not limited to: PCR, RT-qPCR, cloning, next-generation sequencing, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, fine-scale dissections, yeast/bacterial cell culture, and traditional genetics.
* Years of Linux (CentOS/RHEL) system administration experience (pretty good with Ubuntu too!).
* Award-winning presentation, teaching, and communication skills.

## EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT  

### Centre for Advanced Computing
**Scientific Computing Specialist**  
*Jan 2016 - Present*

* Maintained and deployed Linux server infrastructure for academic and industry partners. Examples include setup and administration of the SLURM scheduler on a medium-size compute cluster (~3500 cores) and deployment of research web applications like REDCap and Labkey.
* Performed bioinformatics and data science analytics on a number of projects, including creating a miRNA-Seq analysis pipeline for  a ~1400 sample clinical study and a comprehensive analysis of NSERC's grant database to identify actionable trends in government grant awards.
* Regularly taught programming courses and workshops at several major universities (Queen's University, University of Ottawa), including topics on bash, R, Python, SQL, Git, and GNU Make.
* Provided research and technical support for jobs and software run on CAC computing infrastructure (CentOS/Solaris). 

### University of British Columbia
**M.Sc. Zoology**  
*Jun 2013 - Dec 2015*

* Identified conserved hunger-induced transcriptomic changes in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti through mRNA sequencing. 
* Identified Juvenile Hormone as a behavioral modulator that affects neuronal activity and behavior in adult Drosophila, a novel physiological role for this hormone.
* Wrote an [R package](https://github.com/jstaf/actmon) to enable analysis of Drosophila sleep and locomotor phenotypes.
* Produced [a set of Matlab algorithms](https://github.com/jstaf/fly_tracker) that demonstrated defective post-translational modification of Drosophila neurexin results in autism-like behavioral phenotypes in vivo, identifying a novel target for a new class of autism drugs.
* Wrote a Matlab [confocal microscopy application](https://github.com/jstaf/GCaMP_4D) that enabled characterization of a novel set of second-order Drosophila gustatory neurons.
* Won the 1st place poster prize at every conference/symposium I presented at (CanFly XIII, Zoology Graduate Symposium 2015, Life Sciences Centre Research Day 2015).

### University of British Columbia - Dept. of Cellular and Physiological Sciences
**Research Assistant**  
*Sept 2012 - Dec 2012*

* Developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay that assessed activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in yeast.
* Identified the proteins responsible for triggering activation of the UPR during lipid imbalance through genome-wide screening.

### Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
**Field Technician**  
*May 2012 - Aug 2012*

* Produced a computational model that predicts outbreaks of the Bertha Armyworm across the Canadian prairies based upon developmental and meteorological data.
* Validated the above model by deploying and monitoring a network of pheromone traps across the province of Saskatchewan.
* Published weekly outbreak forecasts for Sclerotinia (fungus) and Melanoplus sanguinipes (grasshopper) pests for Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

### University of British Columbia -- Dept. of Zoology
**Research Assistant**  
*Jan 2011 - Apr 2012* 

* Characterized a novel mechanism of taste-independent nutritional sensing in Drosophila.
* Identified the CREB-PKA and Insulin signaling pathways as modulators of this mechanism.

### University of British Columbia 
B.Sc. Cell Biology and Genetics (with Co-op certificate)  
*Sep 2008 - May 2013*
